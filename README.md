An exploration into the efficacy of AI tools for programming by Ben Gaudreau.

## Introduction
There is no denying the explosive growth of artificial intelligence. In less
than half a decade, the entire field of computer science as a field has been
upended in ways never before seen. Recognizing that the practice of teaching
computer science has struggled to keep pace with its developments, this
repository serves as an archive of experiments and reflections undertaken as a
senior of Computer Science at the University of Southern Maine for COS 420: 
Object Oriented Design instructed by David Levine.

## Disclosure of AI Usage
Given that this is an exploration into artificial intelligence, AI tools have
been utilized in the development of a majority of the software found within this
repository. Documentation within the source code indicates which classes have,
to any extent, been generated by such tools.
  
It needs to be stressed, however, that every report in these iterations contains
no such influence from AI tools. These reflections entirely represent my own
observations, thoughts, and opinions. 

## Getting Started
Each folder in the root directory consists of the following file structure:  
* Source code
  * Java classes and programs (.java file(s))
* Report (.pdf file)
  
To run the source code of a given iteration, copy the .java files from its
respective src folder into a new Java Project. Please note that each iteration
is its own discrete program. Combining files from two different iterations is
sure to result in unintended behavior.
